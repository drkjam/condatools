# condatools

Tools to smooth some of rough edges in conda

A simple project providing some tools to make using conda a more pleasant experience for those accustomed to virtualenv and pip.

## Makefile

This contains a number of targets that allow you to :-

- bootstrap conda itself on your system
- gives you a cross-platform way of working with conda (currently OSX and Linux only)
- give useful advice on environment setup
- new project templates
- options for rebuilding environments, capturing and updating dependencies etc

## condarc

A sample .condarc with a default set of packages so you don't have to specify them on the command line.

## shell aliases

A set of simple shell aliases to ease the transition from virtualenv.
